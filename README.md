## Some common scenarios üìñ

### How to access list of attached files:
In order to parse all files into a PowerApps collection you can use the code below: 
  ```PowerApps
Table(ParseJSON(AttachmentControl.Files))
````

Then you can simply access the files in the collection use code similar to below:
  ```PowerApps
FileName : ThisItem.Value.name
FileContent : ThisItem.Value.content
````

### How to add defualt files to the attachment control
- In PowerApps the most common document storage and management is done through SharePoint. In order to add SharePoint Files as the defaults of this control you can create a power automate flow that returns the base64 content of files. This flow can be called within PowerApps and the files can be stored into a collection that can be passed to the PCF.
- **Example:** Triggering a flow that returns a file's name and content and storing the response in a collection
````PowerApps
With(
    {w_flowResponse: testingbinarydata.Run()},
    ClearCollect(
        col_files,
        Table(
            {
                FileName: w_flowResponse.filename,
                FileContent: w_flowResponse.filecontent
            }
        )
    )
)
````
**Note**: The PCF CAN handle multiple default files being passed in as long as it is in the following schema:
````PowerApps
Table(
  {
  FileName: Sample.filename,
  FileContent: Sample.filecontent
  }
)
````


### How to reset the PCF
Since PCF Components are unable to use the PowerFx Reset Control we will have to use a toggle to "Reset" this PCF.
